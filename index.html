                        Intern/Mentor is a college-level G/T elective course that empowers students to contribute to the larger community by applying, creating, and evaluating knowledge in a specialized area of study.  Students study off-campus with a professional mentor in person or virtually in a self-selected area of interest.  The G/T Resource Teacher facilitates classroom and internship experiences, including instruction in advanced-level research methodologies, college-level writing, and oral presentation.  While working with the mentor, students apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in an authentic, professional environment.
